An engaging crypto-themed idle clicker game with Elo-balanced progression system.

== Description ==

Crypto Miner Tycoon is an addictive idle clicker game where players build their cryptocurrency mining empire from scratch. Click to mine satoshis, purchase upgrades, and watch your passive income grow exponentially!

**Features:**

* **Click-to-Mine Mechanics** - Earn satoshis by clicking the glowing Bitcoin symbol
* **Elo-Balanced Progression** - Sophisticated rating system ensures balanced gameplay
* **10 Unique Upgrades** - Ranging from Basic Pickaxes to Black Hole Extractors
* **Prestige System** - "Hard Fork" to reset with permanent production bonuses
* **Auto-Save** - Game progress saves automatically every 10 seconds
* **Beautiful Design** - Cyberpunk-inspired glassmorphic UI with neon effects
* **Mobile Responsive** - Play on any device
* **Ad Integration** - Optional ad space for monetization

**How It Works:**

The game uses an innovative Elo rating system (similar to chess ratings) to balance upgrade costs. As your miner rating increases with each purchase, more powerful upgrades become available - but they also cost more based on the difficulty curve. This creates a perfectly balanced progression that keeps the game challenging and engaging.

Simply add the shortcode `[crypto_miner_tycoon]` to any page or post to display the game.

**Custom Ad Code:**

You can optionally pass custom ad code via shortcode attribute:
`[crypto_miner_tycoon ad_code="<your ad network code here>"]`
