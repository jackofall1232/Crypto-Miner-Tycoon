A crypto-themed idle clicker game with balanced progression, prestige mechanics, and optional leaderboards.

== Description ==

**Shortcode Arcade Crypto Idle Game** is an idle clicker game where players grow a virtual crypto mining operation over time. Players click to generate in-game currency, purchase upgrades, and unlock passive income systems.

The game is designed for **fair, long-term progression**, using a carefully tuned scaling curve combined with a prestige (“Hard Fork”) system to prevent runaway inflation and repetitive upgrade stacking.

This plugin is self-contained and runs entirely inside WordPress, making it ideal for gaming sites, communities, or experimental content.

**Core Features:**

* **Click-to-Mine Gameplay** – Generate in-game currency through active clicking
* **Balanced Progression Curve** – Upgrade costs scale dynamically for long-term play
* **Multiple Upgrade Paths** – Unlock and stack production upgrades
* **Prestige System (“Hard Fork”)** – Reset progress for permanent production bonuses
* **Auto-Save** – Progress saves automatically at regular intervals
* **Offline Progress** – Earn limited passive income while away
* **Modern UI** – Clean, game-focused interface
* **Mobile Responsive** – Fully playable on desktop, tablet, and mobile

**Optional Advanced Features:**

* **Cloud Saves** – Store player progress in the WordPress database (login required)
* **Leaderboards** – Rank players using prestige-weighted scores
* **Ad Integration** – Optional ad placement via shortcode attribute
* **REST API** – Public endpoints for leaderboard data

**Shortcodes:**

Display the game:
`[sacig_crypto_idle_game]`

Display the game with custom ad code:
`[sacig_crypto_idle_game ad_code="<your ad network code>"]`

Display the leaderboard (requires cloud saves):

**Cloud Saves & Leaderboards:**

When enabled in **Settings → Crypto Idle Game**, cloud saves allow you to:

- Store player progress in your WordPress database
- Require user login for saving/loading games
- Enable competitive leaderboards
- Keep all player data on your own server
